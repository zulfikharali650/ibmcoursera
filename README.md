# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (Coursera)

This repository contains most of my work for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course on Coursera. The course covers a wide range of topics in data science, including machine learning, statistics, and data visualization. The repository includes most of the code and data that I used for the course, as well as solutions to the exercises. I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for other students who are taking the course or who are interested in learning more about data science.

The folders are structured by each courses name.
